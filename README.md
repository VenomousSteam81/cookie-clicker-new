## SAVE FILES

- Do NOT create an issue saying that your save file broke because you used this!
- I will resolve/close your issue without commenting if you do
- Create at least 1 backup of the original version
- I recommend that you do NOT use the save file that you played with this version on the original version, as it might break the file even more

## FAQ

- How do I use this?
    1. You need to download the source OR use git in your console (NOTE: You need internet to download, but after you download, you don't need internet)
      - Wanna know how to download source? Click the green `Code` dropdown, then `Download ZIP` option
      - Wanna know how to use git? Make sure you have git installed, then run `git clone https://github.com/VenomousSteam81/cookie-clicker-new`
    2. If you need to, extract the folder called `cookie-clicker-new` (only if you download the zip file directly)
    3. Double-click the `index.html` file
    4. Upload a save file from original version (not recommended), or create a new save
