## IMPORTANT INFO ABOUT SAVE FILES
* Do NOT create an issue saying that your save file broke because you used this!
    - I will resolve/close your issue without commenting if you do
* Create at least 1 backup
    - Original version
* I recommend that you do NOT use the save file that you played with this version on the original version, as it might break the file even more
